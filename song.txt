[Verse 1]
Born slippy, so look busy
Young scumbag got the keys to the city
I'm knee jerking, black coffee slurping
We're all screwed up but the world's still turnin'
I hug my demons, I fistbump Jesus
I thank Poseidon for a sweet surf season
When I arrive it won't be pretty
From Moscow to the great Mississippi
So

[Pre-Chorus]
I reckon in twenty one seconds
I'm about to blow this thing straight to the heavens
Still stressin', still second guessing
Paid my price but learnt no lesson
So cold, my heavyweight soul
So weighed down by the things that I know
All told, I got too bold
Heart of gold?
No, I do it like that
[Drop]
Like that
I do it like that
Like that (Boy)

[Verse 2]
Space wizards, Hollywood blizzards
Cheatin' at cards with Illuminati lizards
From Indiana out to Valhalla
They know my name, 'cause nobody does it better, yeah
And it's strange but I don't mind
I drive off the edge of the earth to kill time
The storm's comin', you better get runnin'
Wherever I am, I'm starting up something

[Pre-Chorus]
I reckon in twenty one seconds
I'm about to blow this thing straight to the heavens
Still stressing, still second guessing
Paid my price but learnt no lesson (Yeah)
So cold, my heavyweight soul
So weighed down by the things that I know
All told, I got too bold
Heart of gold?
No, I do it like that

[Drop]
Like that
I do it like that
Like that (Boy)
Like that
And if there are better days to come
I just hope to be there for some
And if there are better days to come
Who knows?

[Bridge]
You gotta choose your battles
And make them mean something
Sing great songs, keep that heartbeat bumping
When all else fails and you can't let go
A tin foil hat does more than you know

[Pre-Chorus]
So cold, my heavyweight soul
So weighed down by the things that I know
All told, I got too bold
Heart of gold?
No, I do it like that

[Drop]
Like that
I do it like that
Like that
Like that
Like that (Paid my price but learnt no lesson)
Like that
Like that
I do it like that
