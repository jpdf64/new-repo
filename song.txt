[Verse 1]
Born slippy, so look busy
Young scumbag got the keys to the city
I'm knee jerking, black coffee slurping
We're all screwed up but the world's still turnin'
I hug my demons, I fistbump Jesus
I thank Poseidon for a sweet surf season
When I arrive it won't be pretty
From Moscow to the great Mississippi
So

[Pre-Chorus]
I reckon in twenty one seconds
I'm about to blow this thing straight to the heavens
Still stressin', still second guessing
Paid my price but learnt no lesson
So cold, my heavyweight soul
So weighed down by the things that I know
All told, I got too bold
Heart of gold?
No, I do it like that
